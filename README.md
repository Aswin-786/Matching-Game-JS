# Matching-Game-JS
This is a simple matching game built using JavaScript. The game consists of a group of 12 grids, each containing an image. When the user clicks on a grid, the image flips over to reveal what is underneath. The user can then click on another grid, and if the images on the two grids match, the user receives a score of 1. The user continues to click on grids and try to match images until all the matches have been found.
